FreshRSS ToggleSidebar
======================
Adds a button to the navbar that hides the sidebar when clicked. It also stores the current state so it works when reloading, etc. Note that the button is hidden on mobile because there is already one for hiding/showing the sidebar.

## Installation
To use it, download this repo to a folder named *xExtension-ToggleSidebar* and upload it to your ./extensions directory and enable it on the extension panel in FreshRSS.
